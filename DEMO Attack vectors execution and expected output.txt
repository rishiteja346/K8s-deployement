DEMO Attack vectors execution


Attack 1 — SQL Injection (SQLi)

What: Demonstrate classic SQLi on the “SQL Injection (GET)” or “SQL Injection (Blind)” module in DVWA.

Steps:

1.Log in to DVWA web UI (admin/password).

2.Set Security to low or medium (for demo).

3.Go to SQL Injection (GET) page; there's a parameter (e.g., id) or an input field to fetch a user by ID.

Example payload into input (one-line) to illustrate login bypass / list retrieval:

in bash 

' OR '1'='1


4.Submit; you should see the query returns many rows or bypasses filters.

Expected: The site returns user rows or shows data that should be protected — demonstrating a successful SQL injection.


Attack 2 — Stored Cross-Site Scripting

What: Stored XSS lets an attacker persist JavaScript that executes in other users’ browsers.

Steps:

1.In DVWA, go to XSS (Stored) page.

2.Submit a message/comment with a benign script to show execution. Example payload:

html:

<script>alert('XSS demo')</script>


3.Submit and then reload the page or view the message.

Expected: A browser alert pops up with "XSS demo" — demonstrating script execution in victim’s browser.


Attack 3 — Command Injection (OS Command Injection)

What: DVWA includes a Command Injection module demonstrating unsanitized shell calls.

Steps:

1.Go to Command Injection module in DVWA. Often there's a form that pings an IP or host and prints results.

Example input that demonstrates command injection (benign local):

127.0.0.1; echo injected_marker


Submit.

Expected: The output includes injected_marker showing that the input was appended to the shell command and executed. On Linux you might see the marker in the returned output.
